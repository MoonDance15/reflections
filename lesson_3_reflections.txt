When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    1) Security
    2) Collaboration
    3) Sharing my work - for submission to Udacity (or others e.g. Piazza) and for help.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because other people may update the remote repository and you dont want their changes messing with whatever you are working on. Auto might pull something down that you dont want or need.
    Will Pull overwrite? RC check this please

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Clones are copies of a repository on your local machine
    Branches are a copy of a job at a point in time that can be worked on
    Forks are a copy of a git repository on the Github machine
    Use Clones for copying a repository to have it locally to view or edit
    Use Branches to make a copy of a local job to work on without changing the master
    Use Forks to copy a repository you cant / may not change but that you wish to use / work on 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can compare changes and look at conflicts before committing and also I am able to see what others have done without needing to be connected to the internet eg. when travelling.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
