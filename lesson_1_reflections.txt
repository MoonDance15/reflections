How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    diff -u file1 file2
    This helped by showing only the lines that had changed making it easy to find the error

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a better
programmer in the long term?

    1) Speed up finding faults
    2) The ability to view previous versions

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
    
    cons: you might forget
    pros: you can decide on logical points at which to commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is used for code (as well as single files) and understands that more than one file may change in order to make a change to the program / webpage so it caters for this whereas Google docs focus is on changing a single doc and does not require the complexity that GIT does.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
    
    git log will show you the different versions and info about them like date and time etc, git diff will show you the actual changes made

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
    
    Completely confident because I could always back out the changes or find the error I had introduced

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Any projects I do and any changes I make to files or programs
